  :documentation "Each instance denotes a programming language 
function that computes some procedure.  The slot 'procedure-name'
provides the name of the procedure.  The slot 'procedure-function'
points to the STELLA function object carrying out the computation.
If neither is supplied, the procedure will be looked up by extracting
its name from the name of the instance.  Pointing to a function object
instead of just the code gives us access to argument type information.
Note that we support external non-STELLA functions by creating a dummy
STELLA function object during registration of the computation (see
`register-computation-function' and friends).")
